# Trivia Resources

I've been asked numerous times for the links to trivia question resources, and every time, I respond with, "I just Google, 'JavaScript interview questions' and click on the search result links until I find a handful of questions that I like." Yet people keep asking me for the specific links.

So here are some mostly helpful resources for studying trivia questions. I say, "mostly helpful" because these guides aren't supposed to be the one source of truth for the topics listed - instead, they're just starting points for readers to develop a curiosity about a particular topic and hopefully, motivate them to do their own in-depth research (perhaps with the power of Google) on said topic.

Happy studying, and may the odds be ever in your favor.
